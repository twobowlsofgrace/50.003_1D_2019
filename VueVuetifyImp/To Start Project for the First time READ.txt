Hello!

So for this Vue project,
it makes use of a few things

1) Vue CLI3
2) Vuetify

which you have to install ^

To run the project,
cd acentureist
npm run serve

(In case you want to create a new project and want it to be compatible)
As for the features that was selected when I setup the project, I did a manual selection of
Babel,  Linter, Router

Use history mode for router: Yes
Pick Additional lint features: Lint on save
Where do you prefer placing config for babel, PostCSS, EsLint, etc? : in package.json
